For this project, there are only 2 tables. One of which is called the currency table. This tables only contains 'from' and 'to'. This table is used in order to ease up the process of reporting to the user what currency is being tracked. The second table has 4 columns: from, to, date, and rate. the primary key for this table is (from,to,date). the table was designed this way because the fields are simple enough so that any desired data can be acquired with a single SQL query.
